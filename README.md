limit orderbook distributed engine

The ultimate goal of this project is to discover whether the new Google [Service Weaver](https://serviceweaver.dev/) framework is robust enough to create a production-ready distributed scalable limit orderbook matching engine 

Service Weaver is a programming framework for writing, deploying, and managing distributed applications. You can run, test, and debug a Service Weaver application locally on your machine, and then deploy the application to the cloud with a single command.
